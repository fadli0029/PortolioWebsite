# My Portolio Website

I developed this website after finishing two full-stack Web Development courses in Udemy, totaling to 59 hours. This website is where I will showcase all my projects, update my skills progress, resume and etc. Building this website has been such a great adventure for me and I look forward to developing more websites in my free time!


**The content of this portfolio website will be updated from time to time, as I continue to make more projects in the future. Stay tuned!**
